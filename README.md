# MP3 to Podlove HTML generator

In order to easily publish a podcast on a webpage built with Google Sites, this script watches a directory of MP3 files and generates a HTML page with the excellent [Podlove Web Player](https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-web-player/) widget that can then be embedded.

Focus was on easy of use for end-users: just upload via SFTP and the file appears.

This is not meant as a professional podcast publication tool, only for personal convenience. I'm glad if it happens to scratch someone elses itch as well.
